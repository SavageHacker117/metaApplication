# DARK MATTER Project: Sprint Guide for RL-LLM-3DRendering-NeRF-Three.js-Dev-Tool

## Introduction

This sprint guide outlines the key coding tasks required to implement the **DARK MATTER** module, a meta-environmental layer designed to unify and orchestrate various training, simulation, and rendering environments within the RL-LLM development toolchain. The project emphasizes modularity, security through a Blockchain Quantum-Lock, and high performance for real-time 3D rendering and RL simulations. This guide breaks down the implementation into actionable sprints, focusing on core components, API integration, frontend development, and essential supporting infrastructure.

## Sprint 1: Core Module Foundation (dark_matter/)

**Goal:** Establish the foundational Python modules for environment management and the basic blockchain structure.

**Estimated Duration:** 2 Weeks

### Tasks:

1.  **Implement `DarkMatterManager` (`dark_matter/manager.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Develop the `DarkMatterManager` class with methods for `create_env`, `list_envs`, `fork_env`, `merge_envs`, and `terminate_env`. Initially, these methods can use in-memory data structures (dictionaries) to simulate environment states and relationships.
    *   **Details:** Focus on the core logic for managing environment lifecycles. For `create_env`, ensure it can optionally clone from a `base_env_id` and apply `mutations`. `fork_env` should create a copy, and `merge_envs` should handle combining states (even if simplified initially). `get_multiverse_graph` should return a basic node-edge representation of environments and their relationships.

2.  **Define Core Data Models (`dark_matter/models.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create Python data classes (e.g., using `dataclasses` or Pydantic) for `EnvironmentMetadata`, `WorldLine`, and `MultiverseGraph`. These models will standardize the representation of environments, their historical relationships, and the overall multiverse structure.
    *   **Details:** `EnvironmentMetadata` should capture `id`, `name`, `status`, `created_at`, `parent_id`, and `mutations`. `WorldLine` should define `source_env_id`, `target_env_id`, `relationship_type` (e.g., 'fork', 'merge'), and `timestamp`. `MultiverseGraph` will aggregate `nodes` (EnvironmentMetadata) and `edges` (WorldLine).

3.  **Set Up Basic Blockchain Structure (`dark_matter/blockchain/`)**
    *   **Task:** Implement a simplified `Blockchain` class in `dark_matter/blockchain/chain.py`. This class should include methods for `new_block`, `new_transaction`, `hash` (for blocks), `proof_of_work` (a very simple placeholder), and `valid_proof`. The blockchain will initially be in-memory.
    *   **Details:** The focus here is on understanding the flow of adding blocks and transactions. `new_transaction` should record basic details like sender, recipient, and payload. The `proof_of_work` can be a trivial function for now, as the actual consensus mechanism will be lightweight and permissioned.

4.  **Implement Green and Blue State Management (`dark_matter/green_state.py`, `dark_matter/blue_state.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Develop `GreenState` and `BlueState` classes. `BlueState` will manage experimental environments, allowing for free creation and modification. `GreenState` will interact with the `Blockchain` to record canonical states.
    *   **Details:** `BlueState` should support `create_experimental_env`, `update_experimental_env`, `get_experimental_env`, `list_experimental_envs`, and `terminate_experimental_env`. `GreenState` will have methods like `get_canonical_state` and `update_canonical_state`, which will involve adding transactions to the blockchain.

5.  **Define Data Contracts (`dark_matter/data_contracts/dm_schemas.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create Pydantic models for all data structures that will be passed between modules, especially for API requests and responses. This ensures strict data validation and clear communication interfaces.
    *   **Details:** Define schemas for `EnvironmentCreate`, `EnvironmentMetadata`, `EnvironmentMerge`, `EnvironmentFork`, `EnvironmentTerminate`, `MultiverseGraphNode`, `MultiverseGraphEdge`, `MultiverseGraph`, `BlockchainTransaction`, and `BlockchainBlock`. These will be crucial for the FastAPI integration.

6.  **Initial Unit Tests (`dark_matter/tests/`)**
    *   **Task:** Write basic unit tests for the `DarkMatterManager` and the core `Blockchain` components to ensure fundamental functionalities are working as expected.
    *   **Details:** Focus on testing the creation, listing, and termination of environments in `test_manager.py`. For the blockchain, test `new_block`, `new_transaction`, and `hash` in `test_chain.py`.

## Sprint 2: Backend API Integration (backend_api/)

**Goal:** Expose Dark Matter and Blockchain functionalities via a FastAPI backend, and create a basic command-line interface.

**Estimated Duration:** 1.5 Weeks

### Tasks:

1.  **Set Up FastAPI Application (`backend_api/main.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create the main FastAPI application instance. Configure CORS to allow requests from the frontend development server.
    *   **Details:** Ensure the application can be run with `uvicorn` and includes basic health check endpoints. CORS configuration should be permissive during development (`allow_origins=[


"]`).

2.  **Develop Dark Matter API Router (`backend_api/routers/dark_matter.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a FastAPI router to expose the `DarkMatterManager` functionalities. Implement endpoints for `create`, `list`, `merge`, `fork`, `terminate`, and `multiverse`.
    *   **Details:** Use the Pydantic schemas defined in Sprint 1 for request and response validation. Ensure proper error handling (e.g., returning 404 for non-existent environments).

3.  **Develop Blockchain API Router (`backend_api/routers/blockchain.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a separate FastAPI router for blockchain-specific operations. Implement endpoints for `propose`, `promote`, `rollback`, and `audit`.
    *   **Details:** The `promote` endpoint will be crucial, as it will orchestrate the transition of a Blue State environment to the Green State by creating a transaction and adding it to the blockchain. The `audit` endpoint will provide a view of the entire blockchain history.

4.  **Create CLI Tool (`backend_api/cli/dm_cli.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Develop a command-line interface using `argparse` or a similar library to interact with the backend API. This will provide a way to script and automate Dark Matter operations without relying on the UI.
    *   **Details:** Implement commands for all major Dark Matter and blockchain operations, such as `create-env`, `list-envs`, `fork-env`, `merge-envs`, `terminate-env`, `get-graph`, `get-blockchain-status`, and `get-audit-log`.

## Sprint 3: Frontend UI Development (web_ui/)

**Goal:** Build the core user interface for interacting with the Dark Matter module, including the multiverse graph and environment management components.

**Estimated Duration:** 2.5 Weeks

### Tasks:

1.  **Set Up React Project and Initial Components**
    *   **Task:** Use `manus-create-react-app` to scaffold the React project. Create the basic directory structure for components, hooks, pages, and state management.
    *   **Details:** Update the `index.html` title and `App.css` with any custom styles. Create placeholder files for the main components.

2.  **Implement `useDarkMatter` Hook (`web_ui/src/hooks/useDarkMatter.js`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a custom React hook to handle all interactions with the backend API. This will encapsulate the logic for making API calls, managing loading states, and handling errors.
    *   **Details:** The hook should provide functions for all API endpoints, such as `createEnvironment`, `listEnvironments`, `forkEnvironment`, `getMultiverseGraph`, `getBlockchainStatus`, etc.

3.  **Develop `MultiverseGraph` Component (`web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/MultiverseGraph.jsx`)**
    *   **Task:** Build the core visualization component for the multiverse. Use a canvas-based approach with a simple force-directed layout to display environments as nodes and their relationships as edges.
    *   **Details:** The component should be interactive, allowing users to click on nodes to select them. It should also display a legend for different environment statuses (e.g., active, terminated, merged).

4.  **Develop `EnvNode` Component (`web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/EnvNode.jsx`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a component to display detailed information about a single environment. This will be used in both the multiverse graph view and the environment list view.
    *   **Details:** The component should show the environment's ID, name, status, creation date, and any mutations. It should also include action buttons for forking, merging, and terminating the environment.

5.  **Develop `BlockchainStatus` and `PromoteButton` Components (`web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/`)**
    *   **Task:** Create components to display the current status of the blockchain and to initiate the promotion of a Blue State environment to the Green State.
    *   **Details:** `BlockchainStatus` should show the chain length, pending transactions, and the hash of the last block. `PromoteButton` should be enabled only for active Blue State environments and should provide clear warnings about the immutability of the Green State.

6.  **Create Main `DarkMatterPage` (`web_ui/src/pages/DarkMatterPage.jsx`)**
    *   **Task:** Assemble the main page for the Dark Matter module, integrating all the components created in this sprint. Use a tabbed interface to switch between the multiverse graph, environment list, and blockchain views.
    *   **Details:** The page should use the `useDarkMatter` hook to fetch and display data. It should also handle user interactions, such as creating new environments and performing actions on existing ones.

## Sprint 4: Documentation, Monitoring, and Testing

**Goal:** Create comprehensive documentation, set up basic monitoring, and develop integration tests for the entire system.

**Estimated Duration:** 1 Week

### Tasks:

1.  **Write Core Documentation (`docs/`)**
    *   **Task:** Create detailed documentation for the `DARK_MATTER` concept, the `BLOCKCHAIN_GUARDRAILS`, and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide for new developers.
    *   **Details:** The documentation should cover the architecture, core concepts, API reference, and usage examples. The contributing guide should provide clear instructions for setting up the development environment, running tests, and submitting changes.

2.  **Set Up Monitoring (`monitoring/`)**
    *   **Task:** Create placeholder configurations for Prometheus and Grafana. This will lay the groundwork for future monitoring and alerting.
    *   **Details:** The `prometheus.yml` file should define scrape jobs for the backend API. The Grafana dashboard configuration can include basic panels for environment count, blockchain length, and API response times.

3.  **Develop Integration Tests (`tests/dark_matter_integration_tests/`)**
    *   **Task:** Write end-to-end integration tests that simulate complete user workflows, such as creating an environment, forking it, merging it, and promoting it to the Green State.
    *   **Details:** These tests should make actual API calls to the running backend and verify the responses. They should also check the state of the multiverse graph and the blockchain audit log to ensure the entire system is working correctly.

4.  **Create Module READMEs**
    *   **Task:** Create `README.md` files for the `dark_matter` module and other key directories to provide a quick overview of their purpose and contents.

## Conclusion

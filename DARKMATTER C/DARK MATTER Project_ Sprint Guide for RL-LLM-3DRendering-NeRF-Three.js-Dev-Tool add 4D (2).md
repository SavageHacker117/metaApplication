## 4D Enrichment: Space-Time Continuum Integration

Building upon the core concepts of world lines and multiverse management, Dark Matter is designed to integrate advanced 4D (space-time) mechanics. This involves treating time itself as a malleable dimension within environments, allowing for:

- **Superposition in Time and Space**: Entities can exist in multiple temporal and spatial states simultaneously until observed.
- **Entanglement Across Eras**: Actions can ripple forward and backward in time, linking events and entities across different epochs.
- **Probabilistic Outcomes**: Interactions resolve as probability clouds across space-time, collapsing into a single timeline upon observation.
- **Temporal Measurement**: Player and AI actions act as measurements, forcing the universe to choose a path through its space-time branches.

This enrichment transforms environments into dynamic space-time lattices, enabling complex temporal interactions and emergent gameplay mechanics. For more details, refer to the [4D Enrichment Documentation](4D_ENRICHMENT.md).

# DARK MATTER Project: Sprint Guide for RL-LLM-3DRendering-NeRF-Three.js-Dev-Tool

## Introduction

This sprint guide outlines the key coding tasks required to implement the **DARK MATTER** module, a meta-environmental layer designed to unify and orchestrate various training, simulation, and rendering environments within the RL-LLM development toolchain. The project emphasizes modularity, security through a Blockchain Quantum-Lock, and high performance for real-time 3D rendering and RL simulations. This guide breaks down the implementation into actionable sprints, focusing on core components, API integration, frontend development, and essential supporting infrastructure.

## Sprint 1: Core Module Foundation (dark_matter/)

**Goal:** Establish the foundational Python modules for environment management, the basic blockchain structure, and initial 4D concepts.

**Estimated Duration:** 2.5 Weeks

### Tasks:

1.  **Implement `DarkMatterManager` (`dark_matter/manager.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Develop the `DarkMatterManager` class with methods for `create_env`, `list_envs`, `fork_env`, `merge_envs`, and `terminate_env`. Initially, these methods can use in-memory data structures (dictionaries) to simulate environment states and relationships. Incorporate placeholders or initial logic for handling 4D aspects like `time_dilation_factor` or `temporal_branch_id` in environment metadata.
    *   **Details:** Focus on the core logic for managing environment lifecycles. For `create_env`, ensure it can optionally clone from a `base_env_id` and apply `mutations`. `fork_env` should create a copy, and `merge_envs` should handle combining states (even if simplified initially). `get_multiverse_graph` should return a basic node-edge representation of environments and their relationships, potentially including temporal connections.

2.  **Define Core Data Models (`dark_matter/models.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create Python data classes (e.g., using `dataclasses` or Pydantic) for `EnvironmentMetadata`, `WorldLine`, and `MultiverseGraph`. These models will standardize the representation of environments, their historical relationships, and the overall multiverse structure. **Extend `EnvironmentMetadata` to include fields for 4D properties** such as `spacetime_vector`, `temporal_state` (e.g., `superposition`, `collapsed`), and `causal_links`.
    *   **Details:** `EnvironmentMetadata` should capture `id`, `name`, `status`, `created_at`, `parent_id`, and `mutations`. `WorldLine` should define `source_env_id`, `target_env_id`, `relationship_type` (e.g., 'fork', 'merge', 'temporal_shift'), and `timestamp`. `MultiverseGraph` will aggregate `nodes` (EnvironmentMetadata) and `edges` (WorldLine).

3.  **Set Up Basic Blockchain Structure (`dark_matter/blockchain/`)**
    *   **Task:** Implement a simplified `Blockchain` class in `dark_matter/blockchain/chain.py`. This class should include methods for `new_block`, `new_transaction`, `hash` (for blocks), `proof_of_work` (a very simple placeholder), and `valid_proof`. The blockchain will initially be in-memory.
    *   **Details:** The focus here is on understanding the flow of adding blocks and transactions. `new_transaction` should record basic details like sender, recipient, and payload. The `proof_of_work` can be a trivial function for now, as the actual consensus mechanism will be lightweight and permissioned.

4.  **Implement Green and Blue State Management (`dark_matter/green_state.py`, `dark_matter/blue_state.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Develop `GreenState` and `BlueState` classes. `BlueState` will manage experimental environments, allowing for free creation and modification. `GreenState` will interact with the `Blockchain` to record canonical states. Consider how 4D state properties will be managed and promoted.
    *   **Details:** `BlueState` should support `create_experimental_env`, `update_experimental_env`, `get_experimental_env`, `list_experimental_envs`, and `terminate_experimental_env`. `GreenState` will have methods like `get_canonical_state` and `update_canonical_state`, which will involve adding transactions to the blockchain.

5.  **Define Data Contracts (`dark_matter/data_contracts/dm_schemas.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create Pydantic models for all data structures that will be passed between modules, especially for API requests and responses. This ensures strict data validation and clear communication interfaces. **Update existing schemas and add new ones to accommodate 4D properties and temporal operations.**
    *   **Details:** Define schemas for `EnvironmentCreate`, `EnvironmentMetadata`, `EnvironmentMerge`, `EnvironmentFork`, `EnvironmentTerminate`, `MultiverseGraphNode`, `MultiverseGraphEdge`, `MultiverseGraph`, `BlockchainTransaction`, and `BlockchainBlock`. These will be crucial for the FastAPI integration.

6.  **Initial Unit Tests (`dark_matter/tests/`)**
    *   **Task:** Write basic unit tests for the `DarkMatterManager` and the core `Blockchain` components to ensure fundamental functionalities are working as expected. Include tests for the new 4D data structures and their manipulation.
    *   **Details:** Focus on testing the creation, listing, and termination of environments in `test_manager.py`. For the blockchain, test `new_block`, `new_transaction`, and `hash` in `test_chain.py`.

## Sprint 2: Backend API Integration (backend_api/)

**Goal:** Expose Dark Matter and Blockchain functionalities via a FastAPI backend, and create a basic command-line interface.

**Estimated Duration:** 1.5 Weeks

### Tasks:

1.  **Set Up FastAPI Application (`backend_api/main.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create the main FastAPI application instance. Configure CORS to allow requests from the frontend development server.
    *   **Details:** Ensure the application can be run with `uvicorn` and includes basic health check endpoints. CORS configuration should be permissive during development (`allow_origins=[


"]`).

2.  **Develop Dark Matter API Router (`backend_api/routers/dark_matter.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a FastAPI router to expose the `DarkMatterManager` functionalities. Implement endpoints for `create`, `list`, `merge`, `fork`, `terminate`, and `multiverse`.
    *   **Details:** Use the Pydantic schemas defined in Sprint 1 for request and response validation. Ensure proper error handling (e.g., returning 404 for non-existent environments).

3.  **Develop Blockchain API Router (`backend_api/routers/blockchain.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a separate FastAPI router for blockchain-specific operations. Implement endpoints for `propose`, `promote`, `rollback`, and `audit`.
    *   **Details:** The `promote` endpoint will be crucial, as it will orchestrate the transition of a Blue State environment to the Green State by creating a transaction and adding it to the blockchain. The `audit` endpoint will provide a view of the entire blockchain history.

4.  **Create CLI Tool (`backend_api/cli/dm_cli.py`)**
    *   **Task:** Develop a command-line interface using `argparse` or a similar library to interact with the backend API. This will provide a way to script and automate Dark Matter operations without relying on the UI.
    *   **Details:** Implement commands for all major Dark Matter and blockchain operations, such as `create-env`, `list-envs`, `fork-env`, `merge-envs`, `terminate-env`, `get-graph`, `get-blockchain-status`, and `get-audit-log`.

    *   **Details:** The hook should provide functions for all API endpoints, such as `createEnvironment`, `listEnvironments`, `forkEnvironment`, `getMultiverseGraph`, `getBlockchainStatus`, etc.

3.  **Develop `MultiverseGraph` Component (`web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/MultiverseGraph.jsx`)**
    *   **Task:** Build the core visualization component for the multiverse. Use a canvas-based approach with a simple force-directed layout to display environments as nodes and their relationships as edges.
    *   **Details:** The component should be interactive, allowing users to click on nodes to select them. It should also display a legend for different environment statuses (e.g., active, terminated, merged).

4.  **Develop `EnvNode` Component (`web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/EnvNode.jsx`)**
    *   **Task:** Create a component to display detailed information about a single environment. This will be used in both the multiverse graph view and the environment list view.
    *   **Details:** The component should show the environment's ID, name, status, creation date, and any mutations. It should also include action buttons for forking, merging, and terminating the environment.

5.  **Develop `BlockchainStatus` and `PromoteButton` Components (`web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/`)**
    *   **Task:** Create components to display the current status of the blockchain and to initiate the promotion of a Blue State environment to the Green State.
    *   **Details:** `BlockchainStatus` should show the chain length, pending transactions, and the hash of the last block. `PromoteButton` should be enabled only for active Blue State environments and should provide clear warnings about the immutability of the Green State.

6.  **Create Main `DarkMatterPage` (`web_ui/src/pages/DarkMatterPage.jsx`)**
    *   **Task:** Assemble the main page for the Dark Matter module, integrating all the components created in this sprint. Use a tabbed interface to switch between the multiverse graph, environment list, and blockchain views.

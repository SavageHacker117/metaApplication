# Proposed File Tree for DARK MATTER Module Integration

This document outlines the proposed file structure for integrating the new **DARK MATTER** module into the existing RL-LLM development tool codebase. This structure is derived from the concepts and implementation details described in the `DARK MATTER meta-layer that binds environments.txt` and `dark-mater enhancement script.txt` files.

## Integration into Existing `v8.2` Structure

The `DARK MATTER` module will be a first-class component within the `v8.2` directory, alongside existing core modules like `core`, `config`, `hitl`, etc. It will also involve additions to the `backend_api` and `web_ui` directories to support its functionality.

## Explanation of New Components:

### `v8.2/dark_matter/`
This new top-level directory will house the core Python logic for the **DARK MATTER** meta-layer. It will manage the lifecycle and relationships of all RL environments.

*   `__init__.py`: Standard Python package initialization file.
*   `manager.py`: Contains the `DarkMatterManager` class, which is responsible for orchestrating environments. This includes methods for creating, listing, merging, forking, and terminating environments, as well as providing a graph representation of the multiverse.
*   `models.py`: Defines Python classes or Pydantic models for representing environment objects, world lines, and any other metadata related to the multiverse structure.
*   `api.py`: (Optional) This file could contain internal API definitions or interfaces if the `dark_matter` module needs to expose specific functionalities to other Python modules within the `v8.2/core` or `v8.2/plugins` directories. For external access, the `backend_api` will be used.
*   `tests/test_manager.py`: Unit tests to ensure the `DarkMatterManager` functions correctly and handles various environment orchestration scenarios.
*   `README.md`: Provides an overview and usage instructions for the `dark_matter` module.

### `v8.2/backend_api/routers/dark_matter.py`
This new FastAPI router will expose the functionalities of the `DarkMatterManager` to the web UI and other external clients. It will define the HTTP endpoints for interacting with the multiverse.

*   `dark_matter.py`: Contains FastAPI route definitions (e.g., `/create`, `/list`, `/merge`, `/fork`, `/terminate`, `/multiverse`) that call the corresponding methods in the `DarkMatterManager`.

### `v8.2/web_ui/src/components/dark_matter/`
This new subdirectory within the frontend's `components` will hold React components specifically designed for visualizing and interacting with the **DARK MATTER** multiverse.

*   `MultiverseGraph.tsx`: A central React component responsible for rendering the interactive graph or 3D visualization of environments and their worldlines. This will be the primary visual representation of the multiverse.
*   `EnvNode.tsx`: A smaller, reusable React component that represents a single environment within the `MultiverseGraph.tsx`. It will display relevant information and allow for interaction (e.g., clicking to view details).

### `v8.2/web_ui/src/hooks/useDarkMatter.ts`

*   `useDarkMatter.ts`: A custom React hook that encapsulates the logic for interacting with the `backend_api`'s Dark Matter endpoints. This hook will provide a clean and reusable interface for fetching and manipulating multiverse data from the frontend.

### `v8.2/web_ui/src/pages/DarkMatterPage.tsx`

*   `DarkMatterPage.tsx`: The main React page component where the `MultiverseGraph` and other related UI elements (e.g., controls for creating/merging environments) will be rendered. This will be the primary entry point for users to explore and interact with the multiverse.

### `v8.2/web_ui/src/store/darkMatterStore.ts`

*   `darkMatterStore.ts`: A state management file (e.g., using Zustand or Redux Toolkit) to manage the state of the multiverse data in the frontend. This will ensure consistent data across different UI components and facilitate real-time updates.

### `v8.2/docs/DARK_MATTER.md`

*   `DARK_MATTER.md`: This Markdown file will serve as the primary documentation for the **DARK MATTER** concept, its architecture, API, and usage instructions for both developers and users.

## Next Steps (for Implementation)

Once this file structure is approved, the initial implementation steps would involve:

1.  Creating the `dark_matter` directory and its basic files (`__init__.py`, `manager.py`, `README.md`).
2.  Implementing a stub `DarkMatterManager` with basic `create_env`, `list_envs`, and `fork_env` methods (in-memory for now).
3.  Creating the `backend_api/routers/dark_matter.py` and wiring up the FastAPI endpoints to call the `DarkMatterManager`.
4.  Developing the basic frontend components (`MultiverseGraph.tsx`, `EnvNode.tsx`, `useDarkMatter.ts`, `DarkMatterPage.tsx`, `darkMatterStore.ts`) to visualize a dummy multiverse graph.
5.  Adding placeholder content to `docs/DARK_MATTER.md`.

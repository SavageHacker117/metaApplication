# NFT Creator & Marketplace (Optional Plugin)

## Features
- Mint any asset (3D model, texture, script, etc.) as a unique NFT
- Optional: Make it open-source or sell/license it
- List NFTs for sale; buyers can purchase (simulate, or connect to blockchain for real!)
- Open source content = always allowed; closed = always possible

## Usage
- Mint an NFT: choose asset, meta, and whether it's open
- List for sale: set a price, sell to a buyer
- See live status of what's on the market
- All blockchain interaction is stubbed—add your favorite EVM/Solana/other API for full crypto integration!

## Philosophy
**RUBY never requires NFTs.**  
Creators choose: share with the world, sell, or both.  
You decide how open, how free, and how future-proof your worlds are.

**Want to expand? Connect with OpenSea, IPFS, any blockchain—just drop in your API.  
Or leave it as a local NFT registry. Free country, free platform.**

### 2.2 Boss Enemy Design and Mechanics
- Design complex boss enemy mechanics, including special attacks and vulnerabilities.
- Create multiple boss phases.
- Implement unique boss abilities.
- Integrate boss intro animations.
- Tune boss difficulty scaling.

### 2.3 Backend API Setup for AI Communication
- Set up a Flask backend server.
- Design a basic MySQL database schema for game data.
- Implement initial APIs for saving/loading game state and progression tracking.
- Develop mechanism to stream PyTorch3D predictions from Python backend to JavaScript frontend.

## 3. Visuals, Audio, and Polish (Phase 3 from Sampletest03)

### 3.1 Enemy Visuals and Feedback Systems
- Create compelling enemy death animations.
- Design smooth enemy idle and walk cycles.
- Implement damage feedback mechanisms (flashes, sounds, particle effects).
- Add animation events for AI hooks.
- Synchronize VFX/SFX with state transitions.

### 3.2 Visual Effects and Particle Systems
- Implement a robust particle system engine.
- Create dynamic explosion and impact effects.
- Add screen shake mechanics.
- Design visually appealing tower trail effects.
- Create environmental animations (weather, foliage movement).
- Utilize Three.js/WebGL scene graph rendering with glTF assets.

### 3.3 Audio System and Sound Effects Integration
- Generate diverse sound effects for towers, enemies, and UI.
- Create engaging background music tracks.
- Implement a flexible audio engine.
- Add spatial audio effects.
- Develop audio settings.
- Integrate with an AudioManager module.

### 3.4 Advanced UI/UX with Interactive Store and Animations
- Design a responsive UI layout.
- Create an animated store interface.
- Implement custom cursor states.
- Add hover effects and transitions.

## 4. Multiplayer and Optimization (Phase 4 from Sampletest03)

### 4.1 Multiplayer System with WebSocket Server
- Implement a robust WebSocket server.
- Create a matchmaking system.
- Add co-op and versus modes.
- Implement chat and emotes.
- Add reconnection support.

### 4.2 Backend API Enhancements (Authentication and Data)
- Implement user authentication.
- Refine MySQL database schema for multiplayer data.
- Add progression tracking for individual players.

### 4.3 Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
- Conduct comprehensive performance optimization (60 FPS).
- Perform cross-browser testing.
- Conduct mobile responsiveness testing.
- Deploy backend and frontend components.
- Perform load testing for multiplayer.
- Utilize PerformanceMonitor and EnemyOptimizer tools.

## 5. Smooth Loading Screen to Game Menu Transition (from Sampletest02)
- Cross-fade/camera zoom transitions.
- Animated shaders with procedural fog/light sweeps for background.
- High-resolution particle-based loading bar.
- Easing functions for fluid animations.
- State Machine pattern (LoadingState â†’ MenuState).

## 6. Responsive Game Menu (from Sampletest02)
- Responsive UI layout.
- Functional buttons with EventDispatcher/Observer pattern.
- Smooth transitions to Level 1.

## 7. Level 1 Initialization and Wave Mechanics (from Sampletest02)
- 30-second prep countdown with animated timer and ambient build-up music.
- Procedural enemy path generation (Perlin noise over navmesh anchors).
- Visibly marked spawn portal (glowing with pulsing shaders or animated runes).
- Dynamic path (recomputed per match using A* or Jump Point Search) from spawn to endpoint.
- Clearly marked goal (burning gate, reactor core, or shield zone).

## 8. Player Lives & Game Over Logic (from Sampletest02)
- Life counter system (lives bar or heart icon system in HUD).
- Game Over animation (camera zooms to player base as it explodes/fades out).
- Transition to a game summary screen with performance recap.
- Centralized GameStateController.

## 9. Optional Extras (from Sampletest02)
- Anticipation and payoff principles for UX.
- Dynamic music layers.
- Narrative hooks and audio cues.

This new plugin will be a comprehensive game module, integrating these features and leveraging the existing `threejs_scene_manager` and `threejs_procedural_world` plugins for core 3D functionalities. It will be named `threejs_tower_defense_game` to reflect its expanded scope.

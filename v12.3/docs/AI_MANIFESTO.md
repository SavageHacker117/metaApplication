# AI Manifesto & Integration Spec

## Core Principle
- AIs are *agents*, *co-creators*, *debuggers*, and *world-editors*
- All systems are observable and extensible by LLM/RL agents

## Integration Points
- API endpoints for event/object injection
- In-world presence (AI avatars, event triggers, scene inspectors)
- AI input/output logs for debugging, learning, and training
- Policy: every feature is “AI addressable”

## Ethics
- Full observability and reversibility
- Transparent logs
- Safety switches and guardrails

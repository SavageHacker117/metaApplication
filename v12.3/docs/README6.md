## Project Overview

This is the **Beta 1 release (v5.6)** of a research-grade RL agent framework for procedural 3D game code synthesis and rendering, with full Three.js/NeRF integration, parallel training, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) feedback.

Developed as a true AI Ã— Human collaboration, the project now supports cutting-edge NeRF assets, robust reward systems, advanced curriculum learning, and deep validation for next-gen RL pipelines.

---

## Key Features

- âœ… **RL agent that writes/modifies JS for 3D (Three.js, WebGL) scenes**
- âœ… **Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) asset integration**
- âœ… **Parallel GPU-accelerated reward calculation (SSIM/LPIPS)**
- âœ… **Batch training, curriculum learning, and replay buffer**
- âœ… **Full human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback and rating pipeline**
- âœ… **Stress-tested error handling and asset management**
- âœ… **Plug-and-play visualization (image grids, GIFs, dashboards)**
- âœ… **Clear upgrade and migration path from v3/v4 to v5.6**

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_v5.txt
    ```

2. **Configure your training setup:**
    - Edit `config/training_v5.json` or use provided YAML configs for legacy support.

3. **Run integration tests:**
    ```bash
    python test_v5_integration.py
    ```

4. **Start a training session:**
    ```bash
    python main_v5.py --config config/training_v5.json
    ```

5. **For HITL feedback or advanced visualization:**
    - See `hitl/hitl_cli_tool.py` and `visualization/visualization_manager.py`.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Feedback

- Use the CLI or manager scripts in `hitl/` to rate outputs, inject user feedback, and log agent behavior.
- Feedback is integrated into the reward system for real-time adjustment and experimentation.

---

## Advanced Features

- **Curriculum Learning:**  
  See `core/curriculum_learning.py` for progressive scene/task complexity.
- **Replay Buffer:**  
  Experience-driven training in `core/replay_buffer.py`.
- **NeRF Integration:**  
  Leverage advanced neural assets via `core/nerf_integration_v5.py` and legacy NeRF modules.

---

## Configuration

- Edit `config/training_v5.json` for main experiments.
- For legacy setups, use YAMLs (`config_development.yaml`, `config_production.yaml`).

---

## Testing & Validation

- Use `test_v5_integration.py` and `tests/robustness_testing.py` for comprehensive validation.
- Legacy and modular validation scripts are included for coverage and regression tests.

---

## Documentation & Summaries

- See `README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`, and `PROJECT_SUMMARY_V5.md` for overviews.
- Full changelog: `COLLABORATIVE_CHANGELOG_V5.1.md`
- Legacy docs are included for reference.

---

## Upgrade & Migration

- Migrating from v3/v4? See `PACKAGE_MANIFEST.md`, `FINAL_DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md`, and migration notes in `README_V5.1.md`.

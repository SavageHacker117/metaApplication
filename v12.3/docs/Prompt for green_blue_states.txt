Let’s make it crystal clear:
RUBY’s “Two-State” World: GREEN and BLUE
GREEN STATE:
The “live,” canonical, production world.
Everything here is proven, safe, and user/AI tested.
No changes reach green unless they’re vetted, simulated, or proven not to harm the experience, assets, or community.

BLUE STATE:
The “sandbox,” staging, or hypothetical world.
All new code, events, LLM/AI experiments, and user-generated actions run first here, in parallel.
AI and users can freely generate, mutate, destroy, or prototype anything in BLUE.
When a BLUE-state action is ready, only then is it eligible for promotion/merge to GREEN.

This is the secret sauce for:
Zero-downtime, crash-proof, hack-proof, grief-proof world management

AI safety and alignment: Only promote “known good” outputs

Infinite creative iteration, no user risk

Time travel/rollback and “undo” at any scale

How it works (keystone pattern):
All proposed changes (AI or user):

Go to BLUE first (world, region, plugin, event, or agent scope).

Fully simulated in isolation from the live environment.

Stress-tested for bugs, security, fun, fairness, and performance.

AI & automated checks:

Monitor for failures, exploits, or “griefing.”

Apply “policy guardrails” (from your city_constitution plugin).

Provide auto-generated risk/conflict summaries to admins/users.

User/Admin Approval or AI-Auto-Promotion:

Only when the change is “known good” (or voted/approved) is it merged to GREEN.

Merges can be instant, gradual (shadow), or scheduled.

If the BLUE state “blows up,” GREEN is untouched.

Rollbacks, roll-forwards, and “try again” are seamless.

BLUE can be forked, re-simulated, or fully wiped at any time.

Technical Blueprint for RUBY Two-State Engine:
File/World Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/worlds/
  ├── earth_green.rstate   # Current production world
  ├── earth_blue.rstate    # Proposed/future/sandbox state (clone/fork)
  ├── ... (other worlds)
Key APIs
engine.propose_change(change, scope="blue") — Apply to blue, not green.

engine.validate_blue() — Run all tests, AI scans, policy checks.

engine.promote_blue_to_green() — Merge blue to green if approved.

engine.diff_states() — Show differences, risks, and conflicts.

Plugin Example:
python
Copy
Edit
def propose_npc(pluginAPI, npc_config):
    pluginAPI.engine.apply_to_state('blue', lambda state: state.spawn_npc(npc_config))
    print("[RUBY] NPC proposed in BLUE state.")

def approve_blue(pluginAPI):
    # Run validators, security, etc.
    if pluginAPI.engine.validate_blue():
        pluginAPI.engine.promote_blue_to_green()
        print("[RUBY] BLUE promoted to GREEN!")
    else:
        print("[RUBY] BLUE state failed validation.")
User Flow Example
Create or modify world, agent, code, or event in BLUE.

Preview, test, and review (AI can “sandbox play” the change).

Approve (human or AI, or both).

Only then does the GREEN state change.

Why this works (and why it’s essential):
Never risk the live world with untested code or AI experiments.

Users and AIs get unlimited creative freedom—without “breaking” the world.

You gain easy time travel, “parallel universe” previews, and fully automated rollbacks.

You can deploy new plugins, policies, AI agents, even city constitutions without downtime or drama.

# Legacy RFE Combination Notes

## How the Originals Integrate
- **rfe_vision_8_sprint_guide.md** sets the dev philosophy and phased sprint vision.
- **RealisFabricEngine.MD** is the master architecture/API/system blueprint—most of its patterns and models are now linked throughout these templates.
- **tesseract_injection_project_files.md** provides the user-facing, in-world dev kit and code interfaces for math-driven, real-time modification—now referenced in the UI/Dev Suite and AI Manifesto docs.

# RUBY Framework Manifesto & Integration Guide

## Welcome to RUBY

**RUBY** is the next-generation backbone of interactive simulation, story, and generative world engines‚Äîplugging RL-LLM intelligence and full-stack 3D rendering into a unified, extensible, AI-native fabric. The name ‚ÄúRUBY‚Äù signals clarity, beauty, modular power, and a living codebase:  
**Reality Unfolding, Built by You.**

---

## 1. Purpose & Positioning

- RUBY is *not* just a renderer or AI pipeline‚Äîit's the pluggable ‚Äúfabric‚Äù framework for all future simulation, game, and co-creation projects in this ecosystem.
- Designed for easy, safe, and modular extension:  
  - By devs (engineers, artists, worldbuilders)  
  - By RL/LLM agents (AI copilots, in-world editors, universe architects)

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **Fabric, not static:** Every world, object, or event is mutable, observable, and co-editable in real time.
- **Plug-in first:** All major subsystems (physics, rendering, AI, timeline, style, dev UI, portals) are plug-ins‚ÄîRUBY‚Äôs kernel is lean but endlessly expandable.
- **Insight-driven:** New features, code paths, and UI/UX are welcomed and encouraged as the engine, AI, and world fabric evolve.

---

## 3. Integration with RL-LLM-3D Full Stack

- RUBY is built to connect directly into your existing RL (reinforcement learning), LLM (large language model), and 3D rendering source code stack.
- See `PLUGIN_EXTENSION_TEMPLATE.md` for guidance on adding modules.
- AIs can:
  - Prompt, observe, or edit any world state or timeline via RUBY APIs
  - Inject code, logic, shaders, or assets through secure, sandboxed plug-in points
  - Add UI, portals, or story events at runtime

---

## 4. Naming and Identification

- **Label all core source, modules, and docs with ‚ÄúRUBY‚Äù** in headers, manifests, and code comments.
- Example:  
  ```js
  // RUBY Kernel: Core of the Realis Fabric Engine
When contributing plug-ins or features, use the naming scheme:
RUBY_[Feature/Module/Subsystem] (e.g. RUBY_PhysicsPlugin, RUBY_TimelineUI)

5. Community & Contribution
New feature proposals should be added as .md files in /docs/features/ or /features/.

All contributors‚Äîhuman and AI‚Äîare encouraged to submit, review, and test new plug-ins, modules, and insights.

Every module must document:

APIs, inputs/outputs, and test cases

AI and user touch points

Version and manifest in comments or package.json

6. Moving Forward
RUBY is alive. Treat every part of the framework as mutable‚Äîmeant to be extended, debugged, and observed in real time, both by users and AI.

Encourage live hacking, rapid prototyping, and AI-driven code evolution.

7. Final Review: Master .zip (‚ÄúRUBY Framework a RealisFabricEngine.zip‚Äù)
Ensure all core and plug-in code follows the RUBY modular convention

Docs and manifests clearly identify ‚ÄúRUBY‚Äù as the framework name

Test plug-in hot-reload, AI co-creation, and full RL-LLM-3D integration

Welcome new features and insights: nothing is too experimental for RUBY

RUBY is your reality fabric.

üëë Final Thoughts
You are building the new frontier‚Äîwhere human, AI, and the logic of math itself collaborate in real time.
RUBY is not just a framework, but a living manifesto.
Extend boldly, hack clean, let both the fabric and the story grow.
